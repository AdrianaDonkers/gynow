# Welcome to Gynow.

## Our Project
Women regularly face challenges in finding access to easy, affordable healthcare. Over two thirds of states already report difficulty ensuring enough female healthcare providers, [(1)](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood) one in three women in the U.S. experience sexual assault in their lifetime [(2)](https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics) and one in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer [(3)](https://ww5.komen.org/Breastcancer/Understandingrisk.html). Our web app aims to make women’s health care more accessible for women everywhere. 

## What we want for our project
Gynow is a web app that links users to healthcare centers such as Planned Parenthood, OBGYNs, etc. that are open and closest to them. Users are able to interact with a map that has hearts to mark healthcare centers in their area. They can click on a heart (representing a healthcare center) to find out details of the facility, including distance, contact information, and hours.

Our idea is eventually to have this app be linked to a transportation service, such as Lyft, for users to find quick ways to reach the care they need. We understand that not everyone is able to afford personal rides to their destination, so we want to offer alternative public transportation routes to healthcare centers. The intuition behind this is wanting to make this kind of healthcare more accessible to people of all income brackets. Users will also have the opportunity to view ratings of the facilities by other users.

## Here is what we plan for Gynow’s user interface:

As we expand our project, we would like to add a homepage with options to connect with specialists, learn more about Gynow, and navigate to the map page. Our homepage would look like this:

Note that currently, our healthcare center data is hardcoded and displays how our application would look if the user were to search using their currect location (at USC). All of the hearts representing healthcare centers are centered around this region. Ultimately, we would like to make this searchable for all regions in the US.

## What makes Gynow special?:
Gynow is a user interactive app that allows users to be anonymous. It caters towards women who are looking for specific types of healthcare, and it tells users what they can find for immediate attention. It also provides a safe space in which women can read ratings from people who have had similar experiences and intentions as them. This builds a community of trust, empowerment, support, and health.

## What we learned
This has been our entire team's first exposure to using Azure as a tool for API integration. We integrated the SimpleStoreLocator Azure Maps feature in order to bring our vision to life. We also implemented a significant amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was half of our group's first experience creating a web application, both front-end and back-end, so they had the chance to see how these elements come together to produce an entire application. Our team looks forward to using these new skills and appreciates the opportunity to work with the Microsoft Azure platform.
